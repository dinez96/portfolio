## 🎨 Creative Direction
The project follows a **Minimalist Brutalism** approach. By removing UI clutter, the focus remains on the fluid motion and the depth of the 3D space. The atmosphere is shaped by dynamic lighting and a curated color palette that reacts to user interaction.

## 📁 Project Structure
- **/src/components/canvas:** Specialized Three.js components and 3D models.
- **/src/components/ui:** 2D overlay elements and responsive navigation.
- **/src/hooks:** Custom hooks for handling 3D events and scroll logic.
- **/src/assets:** Optimized 3D assets (GLTF/GLB) and textures.
